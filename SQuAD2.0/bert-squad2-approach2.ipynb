      "Prediction : full size working engines on what vehicles sometimes use oscillating cylinder steam engines? [SEP] an oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder. instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting ( trunnion ). these engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity,\n",

[ citation needed ] since ireland refused to consent to changes in the treaty of lisbon 2007, there remains one commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the president and the high representative for foreign and security policy ( currently federica mogherini ). the commissioners ( and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold ) are bargained over intensively by the member states. the commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the council to approve, and majority approval of the parliament.\n",

      "Prediction : lobes together? [SEP] lobates have eight comb - rows, originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes ; in species with ( four ) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows. most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion. members of the lobate genera bathocyroe and ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly. unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates ' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row beat in the same mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids. this may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg - like.\n",

      "Prediction : late 1980s the western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the black sea and sea of azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories ( although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the black sea ), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. the impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short - term boost, causing the mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the mnemiopsis - eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993,\n",

      "Prediction : economic growth sufficient for progress on? [SEP] while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals, it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth. the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality. for instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 % per head and 40 % of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction. in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban ki - moon : \" while economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.\n",

      "Prediction : if the apparant force of two fermions is repulsive, what is the spin function? [SEP] however, already in quantum mechanics there is one \" caveat \", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum - like variable called the \" spin \", and there is the pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables. depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons. if two identical fermions ( e. g. electrons ) have a symmetric spin function ( e. g. parallel spins ) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric ( i. e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force ), and vice versa, i. e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric ( i. e. the apparent force must be attractive ). thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables,\n",

[SEP] the development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas. for example, isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. michael faraday and james clerk maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. in the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces ( all except gravity ) are manifestations of matter ( fermions ) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. this standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. the complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. a grand unified theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. physicists are still attempting to develop self - consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. einstein tried and failed\n",
