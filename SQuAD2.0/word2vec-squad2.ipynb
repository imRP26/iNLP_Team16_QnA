Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in June 2005, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits \"Déjà Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\", and \"Beautiful Liar\". Beyoncé also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth studio album, Beyoncé (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                     A self-described \"modern-day feminist\", Beyoncé creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 19 years, she has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist, and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has won 20 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium in 2011. Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and 2014. Forbes magazine also listed her as the most powerful female musician of 2015.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine Ann \"Tina\" Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name. Beyoncé's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former member of Destiny's Child. Mathew is African-American, while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (with African, Native American, French, Cajun, and distant Irish and Spanish ancestry). Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. She was raised in a Methodist household.   \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Beyoncé attended St. Mary's Elementary School in Fredericksburg, Texas, where she enrolled in dance classes. Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes. Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds.

Today, we know that even protons and neutrons are not indivisible, they can be divided into quarks, while electrons are part of a particle family called leptons. Both quarks and leptons are elementary particles, and are currently seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter.   \n19027  These quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The Standard Model of particle physics is currently the best explanation for all of physics, but despite decades of efforts, gravity cannot yet be accounted for at the quantum level; it is only described by classical physics (see quantum gravity and graviton). Interactions between quarks and leptons are the result of an exchange of force-carrying particles (such as photons) between quarks and leptons. The force-carrying particles are not themselves building blocks. As one consequence, mass and energy (which cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to matter (which can be created out of non-matter particles such as photons, or even out of pure energy, such as kinetic energy). Force carriers are usually not considered matter: the carriers of the electric force (photons) possess energy (see Planck relation) and the carriers of the weak force (W and Z bosons) are massive, but neither are considered matter either. However, while these particles are not considered matter, they do contribute to the total mass of atoms, subatomic particles, and all systems that contain them.   \n19028                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The term \"matter\" is used throughout physics in a bewildering variety of contexts: for example, one refers to \"condensed matter physics\", \"elementary matter\", \"partonic\" matter, \"dark\" matter, \"anti\"-matter, \"strange\" matter, and \"nuclear\" matter.

Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        answers  \\\n0                                                                                          [{'text': 'France', 'answer_start': 159}, {'text': 'France', 'answer_start': 159}, {'text': 'France', 'answer_start': 159}, {'text': 'France', 'answer_start': 159}]   \n1                   [{'text': '10th and 11th centuries', 'answer_start': 94}, {'text': 'in the 10th and 11th centuries', 'answer_start': 87}, {'text': '10th and 11th centuries', 'answer_start': 94}, {'text': '10th and 11th centuries', 'answer_start': 94}]   \n2      [{'text': 'Denmark, Iceland and Norway', 'answer_start': 256}, {'text': 'Denmark, Iceland and Norway', 'answer_start': 256}, {'text': 'Denmark, Iceland and Norway', 'answer_start': 256}, {'text': 'Denmark, Iceland and Norway', 'answer_start': 256}]   \n3                                                                                              [{'text': 'Rollo', 'answer_start': 308}, {'text': 'Rollo', 'answer_start': 308}, {'text': 'Rollo', 'answer_start': 308}, {'text': 'Rollo', 'answer_start': 308}]   \n4                                                            [{'text': '10th century', 'answer_start': 671}, {'text': 'the first half of the 10th century', 'answer_start': 649}, {'text': '10th', 'answer_start': 671}, {'text': '10th', 'answer_start': 671}]   \n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ...   \n11868                                             [{'text': 'sthène', 'answer_start': 665}, {'text': 'sthène', 'answer_start': 665}, {'text': 'sthène', 'answer_start': 665}, {'text': 'sthène', 'answer_start': 665}, {'text': 'sthène', 'answer_start': 665}]   \n11869                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        []   \n11870                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        []   \n11871                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        []   \n11872                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        []   \n\n       context_id  \n0               0  \n1               0  \n2               0  \n3               0  \n4               0  \n...           ...  \n11868        1203  \n11869        1203  \n11870        1203  \n11871        1203  \n11872        1203  \n\n[11873 rows x 5 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>question</th>\n      <th>context</th>\n      <th>answers</th>\n      <th>context_id</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>56ddde6b9a695914005b9628</td>\n      <td>In what country is Normandy located?</td>\n      <td>The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France.

Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.</td>\n      <td>[]</td>\n      <td>1203</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>11873 rows × 5 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Exploring the validation dataset a bit more!\n\nprint ('Number of unique contexts in the validation dataset :', len(validation_data['context_id'].unique()))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.140116Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.140510Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.148685Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.140472Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.147325Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Number of unique contexts in the validation dataset : 1204\nCPU times: user 1.3 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.3 ms\nWall time: 1.15 ms\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Getting unique documents from the validation dataset\n\nvalidation_unique_documents = validation_data[['context', 'context_id']].drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop=True)\nvalidation_unique_documents","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.150702Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.151091Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.196528Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.151054Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.195180Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"CPU times: user 22.8 ms, sys: 61 µs, total: 22.9 ms\nWall time: 22.7 ms\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":16,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  context  \\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.   \n1     The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property. The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine.

Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes, Norwegians, Norse–Gaels, Orkney Vikings, possibly Swedes, and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control.   \n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ...   \n1199                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                where  is the mass of the object,  is the velocity of the object and  is the distance to the center of the circular path and  is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.   \n1200                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.   \n1201                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.   \n1202                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.   \n1203                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.   \n\n      context_id  \n0              0  \n1              1  \n2              2  \n3              3  \n4              4  \n...          ...  \n1199        1199  \n1200        1200  \n1201        1201  \n1202        1202  \n1203        1203  \n\n[1204 rows x 2 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>context</th>\n      <th>context_id</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France.

The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property.

Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes, Norwegians, Norse–Gaels, Orkney Vikings, possibly Swedes, and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control.</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1199</th>\n      <td>where  is the mass of the object,  is the velocity of the object and  is the distance to the center of the circular path and  is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.</td>\n      <td>1199</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1200</th>\n      <td>A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.</td>\n      <td>1200</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1201</th>\n      <td>For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.</td>\n      <td>1201</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1202</th>\n      <td>The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.</td>\n      <td>1202</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1203</th>\n      <td>The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.</td>\n      <td>1203</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1204 rows × 2 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Creating a corpus of tokens\n\nvalidation_corpus = validation_unique_documents['context'].tolist()\nvalidation_corpus = [preprocess_string(t) for t in validation_corpus]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.198829Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.199554Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T20:46:55.349686Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T20:46:54.199510Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T20:46:55.348377Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"CPU times: user 1.14 s, sys: 7.11 ms, total: 1.14 s\nWall time: 1.14 s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Defining the Word2Vec model\n\nvectorizer = Word2Vec(sentences=validation_corpus, vector_size=300, window=5, min_count=10, workers=4, epochs=20).wv","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T20:47:11.682969Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T20:47:11.683465Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T20:47:13.442842Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T20:47:11.683419Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T20:47:13.441561Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"CPU times: user 5.18 s, sys: 27.5 ms, total: 5.21 s\nWall time: 1.75 s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Getting the 5 most similar words to a sample word\n\nvectorizer.most_similar('system', topn=5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T20:47:50.623527Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T20:47:50.624456Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T20:47:50.647473Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T20:47:50.624404Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T20:47:50.636616Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"CPU times: user 5.59 ms, sys: 2.11 ms, total: 7.7 ms\nWall time: 2.85 ms\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":20,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"[('complement', 0.9437873363494873),\n ('respond', 0.941889762878418),\n ('innat', 0.9406814575195312),\n ('virus', 0.9395800828933716),\n ('immunolog', 0.9383890628814697)]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Text Transformation\n\nquestion = 'What are the tourist spots in Spain?'    \ntext_transformation(vectorizer, question, True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T20:48:02.126593Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T20:48:02.127001Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T20:48:02.134975Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T20:48:02.126966Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T20:48:02.133365Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Text : What are the tourist spots in Spain?\nVector : ['spain']\nCPU times: user 226 µs, sys: 16 µs, total: 242 µs\nWall time: 247 µs\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
