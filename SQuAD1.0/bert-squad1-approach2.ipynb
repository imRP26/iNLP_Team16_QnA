      "Prediction : yersinia pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern china in 1865, eventually spreading to india. the investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th - century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited hong kong in 1894, among whom was the french - swiss bacteriologist alexandre yersin, after whom the pathogen was named yersinia pestis. the mechanism by which y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by paul - louis simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. this blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. the bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents :\n",
