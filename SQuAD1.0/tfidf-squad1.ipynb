Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend \"Venite Ad Me Omnes\". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.   \n1      As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The university is the major seat of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto. The university through the Moreau Seminary has ties to theologian Frederick Buechner. While not Catholic, Buechner has praised writers from Notre Dame and Moreau Seminary created a Buechner Prize for Preaching.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The College of Engineering was established in 1920, however, early courses in civil and mechanical engineering were a part of the College of Science since the 1870s. Today the college, housed in the Fitzpatrick, Cushing, and Stinson-Remick Halls of Engineering, includes five departments of study – aerospace and mechanical engineering, chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil engineering and geological sciences, computer science and engineering, and electrical engineering – with eight B.S. degrees offered. Additionally, the college offers five-year dual degree programs with the Colleges of Arts and Letters and of Business awarding additional B.A. and Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees, respectively.   \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   All of Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate colleges at the school or are in the First Year of Studies program. The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide incoming freshmen in their first year at the school before they have declared a major. Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested. The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management, collaborative learning, and subject tutoring.

KMC's first international relationship was established in 1975 with the city of Eugene, Oregon, United States. This activity has been further enhanced by establishing formal relationships with 8 other cities: Motsumoto City of Japan, Rochester of the USA, Yangon (formerly Rangoon) of Myanmar, Xi'an of the People's Republic of China, Minsk of Belarus, and Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea. KMC's constant endeavor is to enhance its interaction with SAARC countries, other International agencies and many other major cities of the world to achieve better urban management and developmental programs for Kathmandu.   \n\n       context_id  \n0               0  \n1               1  \n2               2  \n3               3  \n4               4  \n...           ...  \n18886       18886  \n18887       18887  \n18888       18888  \n18889       18889  \n18890       18890  \n\n[18891 rows x 2 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>context</th>\n      <th>context_id</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Architecturally, the school has a Catholic character.

The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

Regionally, several Nepali airlines operate from the city, including Agni Air, Buddha Air, Cosmic Air, Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines, to other major towns across Nepal.</td>\n      <td>18889</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>18890</th>\n      <td>Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat (IRC).

As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The Broncos took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed. Newton was limited by Denver's defense, which sacked him seven times and forced him into three turnovers, including a fumble which they recovered for a touchdown. Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP, recording five solo tackles, 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                CBS broadcast Super Bowl 50 in the U.S., and charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game. The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively.

This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.   \n2063                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.   \n2064                                                                                                                                                For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.   \n2065                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.   \n2066                                                                                                                                          The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.   \n\n      context_id  \n0              0  \n1              1  \n2              2  \n3              3  \n4              4  \n...          ...  \n2062        2062  \n2063        2063  \n2064        2064  \n2065        2065  \n2066        2066  \n\n[2067 rows x 2 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>context</th>\n      <th>context_id</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.

Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.</td>\n      <td>2066</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>2067 rows × 2 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Training the dev model to retrieve the document id 'context_id'\nX_dev = embedding.fit_transform(dev_unique_documents['context'])\nretriever.fit(X_dev, dev_unique_documents['context_id'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T19:40:57.872031Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T19:40:57.872440Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.103650Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T19:40:57.872385Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.102441Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"CPU times: user 221 ms, sys: 2.79 ms, total: 224 ms\nWall time: 223 ms\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":13,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"NearestNeighbors(metric='cosine', n_neighbors=1)"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Visualizing how a sample question is transformed into a vector by the above defined model\n\nquestion = 'What are some of the tourist hotspots in Spain?'\ntransform_text(embedding, question)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.105653Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.106119Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.113805Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.106074Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.112905Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Text : What are some of the tourist hotspots in Spain?\nVector : [array([], dtype='<U13')]\nCPU times: user 1.75 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.75 ms\nWall time: 1.63 ms\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\n# Retrieving the most similar document to the above question and vectorizing the retrieved document\n\nX_question = embedding.transform([question])\ncontext_id = retriever.kneighbors(X_question, return_distance=False)[0][0]\nselected_document = dev_unique_documents.iloc[context_id]['context']\n\ntransform_text(embedding, selected_document)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.114951Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.115237Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.134916Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.115207Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-28T19:40:58.133226Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Text : Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.
